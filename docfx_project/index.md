# Welcome to the Documentation for the Ludus Mini-Game Battery Project!

This site houses the documentation for the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project, a capstone project under development by Team Ludus.

This documentation serves the following purposes:
- It provides a contract for the public API of the project
- It describes the purpose of classes and methods
- It describes important design decisions
- It provides backlinks from the code to important documents such as the SRS and the design document
- It helps our team members write better, more readable code
