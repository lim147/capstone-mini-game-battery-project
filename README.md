# Game Instructions
## Squares
The `Squares` game consists of a number of game rounds that lasts for a total of 55 seconds. In each round, a sequence of squares will light up on the screen. After the sequence is complete, the player must recreate the sequence that was shown, by clicking in order, the positions that the squares were at, on the screen. 

In the first round, there will be 3 squares highlighted on the screen. The number of highlighted squres will increase by one for a new round. Within the time period, the player is expected to finish the round where the number of highlighted squares is up to 8 or 9.

## Balloons

In the `Balloons` game, click on the circle at its centre point as fast as you can. In each round, there will be two balloons that appear: the first balloon always appears at the origin on the screen for the purpose of the calibration; the second balloon appears at a random position on the screen, which will be used as measurement.


## Catch The Thief

The `Catch The Thief` game consists of a grid of nine squares. Over a total of 50 seconds, the thief image may appear on a square, and the person image may appear, on a different square. Either image can disappear or reappear at any time. If the thief image appears on a square, and it is the only image on the screen, the player must press the spacebar key, as fast as possible, to attack the thief. Do not press the spacebar key if there is a person image on any square to avoid hurting the innocent person.

## Image Hit

In the `Image Hit` game, ten different images will be shown on the screen one by one and 4-6 images will belong to the same image theme. There will be obvious features in the images for players to comfirm the theme. The theme of the game will be shown at the top of the page. Players will need to press SPACEBAR if the image's theme is the same with the game theme. Do not press the SPACEBAR if they are different.

## Ball Mini-Games
### Catch The Ball

In the `Catch The Ball`, a soccer ball will be kicked towards the player. The player will need to press any key at the moment that they believe they are able to catch the ball.


### Save One Ball

In the `Save One Ball`, there will be two balls and players can only catch one of them, which should be the first one to arrive. Players will need to find out which ball will come first and then press A key to catch the left ball, and L key to catch the right ball.

### Judge The Ball 

In the `Judge The Ball`, there will be three soccer balls which will each start out a random distance from the player's perspective. The ball in the middle is the player's ball while those to the left and right are reference balls. All balls will then be kicked towards the player at the same time with each ball having a random velocity. After a random duration of time, each ball will disappear at once. The user is expected to move a slider to indicate when they believe their ball would have arrived (had it not disappeared) in relation to the two reference balls.

# Measurement results:
   - Sub-score sequence: a sequence of measured scores for each ability in each game (multiple games could measure the same ability; that's why we call the measured score from one game `sub-score`).
   - Overall score requence: a sequence of measured scores for each ability from all games that measure the ability









# Scoring Mechanism
This scoring of each ability is designed such that a **normal player** would get a score of approximately **50**.

## Squares
The score will be calculated based on:
- Sufficient rounds completed
   - A normal player should complete 5 rounds.
- Length of sequences of highligted squares in each round
   - The longer the length is, the more difficult the current level is, thus the higher potential mark a player will get in the current round
- Time spent to recreate the sequence in each round
   - The shorter time spent, the higher the mark that will be given
- If the player recreates the sequence successfully in each round
   - There will be mark cutdown for missing a square or selecting a wrong square
   - If the player successfully recreates a sequence that is long enough (its length >= 5), they will get bonus marks



## Balloons
A **Mouse** is required for a player to get an accurate score that correctly reflects their competency. Players using the touchpad tend to get a lower score.

Situations that would result in a cut down in score:
- Slow click on the destination balloon in each round;
- Unsuccessful click on the destination balloon in each round;
- Successful click but not close to the centre of the destination balloon;
- Not enough rounds completed



## Catch The Thief
The score will be calculated based on:
- If the player correctly reacts to the images for each round.
- The amount of time player takes to react to images.

## Image Hit
The score will be calculated based on:
- If the player correct regonized the current image
- If the player recognized the image of specified theme correctly, the reaction time of him/her
- If all the keypressing actions during the game are intentional

## Ball Mini-Games
### Catch The Ball
The score will be calculated based on:
- The player's reaction time to the disappearance of the soccer ball compared to the estimated time


### Save One Ball
The score will be calculated based on:
- The player's accuracy in judging the first soccer to arrive


### Judge The Ball
The score will be calculated based on:
- The time when the player moves a slider, compared with the estimated time when the player’s ball arrives
